  You have to make it until the end of the game by managing your country. You can do so by 
  providing energy to your citizens while polluting as less as possible.
  There are a few things to be careful about :
  
 - When you exceed 100 000 Polution Point (PP), or if your population happiness reach 0%
    it's a lose.

   - You can build energy supply that will provide energy. Be careful to the infrastructure you will build.
     for example coal and nuclear plant will pollute a lot throughout the game so you want (and it's 
	 the goal of the game) to avoid to keep them but it also provides a lot of energy.
		
	- You can also build cities to earn more money. However, the more cities you get, the more
	  energy you have to provide and the more your cities will pollute.
	
	- You can also destroy the infrastructures, the forest and the fields. For the energy supply, it will
	  cost third time less the production cost and pollute fourth time less than building it. For the 
	  forest and the fields, it costs !!!! money and !!! PP.
	
	- Be careful when you destroy the fields because it makes the population happiness going down
	  faster and destroying forests will make the PP grow faster too."
