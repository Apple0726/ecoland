  You have to make it until the end of the game by managing your country. You can do so by 
  providing energy to your citizens while polluting as least as possible.
  There are a few things to be careful about:
  
  - When you exceed 100,000 Pollution Points (PP), or if your population happiness reaches 0%,
    you lose the game.

   - You can build energy facilities that will provide energy. Be careful of the infrastructure you build.
     For example coal and nuclear plants will pollute a lot throughout the game so you want (and it's 
	 the goal of the game) to avoid  them but they also provide a lot of energy.
		
	- You can also build cities to earn more money. However, the more cities you get, the more
	  energy you have to provide and the more your cities will pollute.
	
	- You can also destroy the infrastructures you built, as well as trees and farmland. This costs money
	  (1/4th of the building's initial cost) and creates pollution (1/3rd of the building's initial pollution).
	
	- Destroying farmland will make the population unhappy.
	
	- Trees absorb pollution.
	
	- You can also win the game by having only renewable sources of energy and having 100% happiness
	  for a few seconds
	
	- Finally you will get a score depending on your PP and the happiness of your citizens"
